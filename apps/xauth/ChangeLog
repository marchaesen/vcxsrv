    xauth 1.1

commit 0932418d9b47e8240160bcbacbdc38b9bc9870d3
Author: Adam Jackson <ajax@redhat.com>
Date:   Tue Jun 18 12:03:33 2019 -0400

    process: Close a window where no authority file would exist
    
    unlink()ing the old auth file before link()ing the temp to the new is
    just silly. rename() is atomic and will happily clobber the destination,
    and the only thing link() can give you here is the ability to fail on
    filesystems that don't support hardlinks.

commit 42239054b088dcdfc637880a8edf39b841c5ea51
Author: Michal Srb <msrb@suse.com>
Date:   Thu May 31 15:12:36 2018 +0200

    Sort entries from most specific to most generic.
    
    There is no point in adding entry or merging lists if a FamilyWild entry would
    end in front of any entry, or entry without display number would end in front
    of entry with number.
    
    This sorts all entries in order:
      * FamilyWild without display number
      * FamilyWild with display number
      * Other family without display number
      * Other family with display number
    
    The order of the entries in each category is kept.

commit 06a21f7c3d5eb5dc9a86418e87946cc7ac83e437
Author: Michal Srb <msrb@suse.com>
Date:   Thu May 31 15:12:35 2018 +0200

    Merge only entries with equal dpy and protoname.
    
    Merging two lists, or adding entry a into list acts unexpectedly if the list
    contains FamilyWild or entry with an empty display numbers. For example:
    
      > xauth list
      #ffff#6f70656e737573652d74756d626c6577656564#:  MIT-MAGIC-COOKIE-1  1500d80327733252cc42ba469138a259
    
      > xauth add test/unix:2 MIT-MAGIC-COOKIE-1 aabbccddeeff00112233445566778899
      > xauth list
      test/unix:2  MIT-MAGIC-COOKIE-1  aabbccddeeff00112233445566778899
    
    This is because merge_entries compares entries using `match_auth`, which
    follows the same rules as XauGetBestAuthByAddr. Following these rules is good
    when filtering the output of `xauth list`, but for merging we should compare
    for equality. It used to be done that way before commit 1555fff4. That commit
    changed it to improve the `xauth list` behavior, but did not seem consider the
    impact on merge.

    Look for FamilyLocal if inet or inet6 address is loopback
    
    libxcb uses FamilyLocal authorization if the host name or IP in the
    display string is from the loopback device. This patch adds the same
    behavior to xauth.
    This fixes a long standing problem that for ssh tunneled connections
    a display variable of the form: localhost:<N>.<M> leads to correct
    authorization when an X client is started but "xauth list $DISPLAY"
    returns nothing.

    Remove unused TLI ("STREAMSCONN") code from xauth
    
    Has never been converted to build in modular builds, so has been unusable
    since X11R7.0 release in 2005.  All known platforms with TLI/XTI support
    that X11R7 & later releases run on also have (and mostly prefer) BSD
    socket support for their networking API.
    
    And as the comment notes, it never worked right in xauth anyway.

    As an interim measure, replace AM_INIT_AUTOMAKE([dist-bzip2]) with
    AM_INIT_AUTOMAKE([foreign dist-bzip2]). This will prevent the generation
    of the INSTALL file. It is also part of the 24206 solution.

# Keep the tags below under 20 chars each, as they end up combined into
# docker image tags, and docker has a length limit of 128 chars total in tags.
#
# The word after the date doesn't need to be overly descriptive, it exists
# purely to avoid the risk of two people updating an image tag on the same day
# while working on different changes, so it doesn't matter whether that word
# will make sense to someone else. Aim for "nobody else will pick that word
# for their change".
#
# If you update a tag and you get an error like this:
#     cannot parse input: "$image:$tag": invalid reference format
# check the length of $tag; if it's > 128 chars you need to shorten your tag.

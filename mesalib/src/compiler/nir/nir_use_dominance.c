/* This implements dominance and post-dominance of the SSA use graph where
 * instructions are vertices and SSA uses are edges (i.e. edges go from
 * each instruction to all its uses). CF nodes are ignored and irrelevant.
 * It's different from nir_dominance.c, but the algorithm is the same, which
 * is from "A Simple, Fast Dominance Algorithm" by Cooper, Harvey, and Kennedy.
 *
 * Definitions:
 * - Instruction A is post-dominated by instruction B if the result of
 *   instruction A and following intermediate results using the result of
 *   instruction A only affect the result of instruction B. Consequently,
 *   if instruction B was removed, instruction A would become dead including
 *   all instructions computing the intermediate results.
 *   Example: A(load) -> ... -> B(ALU)
 *   Note: This is the foundation of inter-shader code motion from later
 *   shaders to earlier shaders.
 * - Instruction B is dominated by instruction A if all use paths from
 *   all loads to instruction B must go through instruction A.
 *   Note: Unlike post-dominance, dominance is unusable as-is because
 *   the immediate dominator typically doesn't exist if there are non-unary
 *   opcodes (i.e. branches of an expression tree following source operands
 *   don't usually converge to a single instruction unless all instructions
 *   are unary). The solution is to ignore loads like load_const to allow
 *   non-unary opcodes, which would be the foundation of inter-shader code
 *   motion from earlier shaders to later shaders, such as 2 output stores
 *   having only 1 ALU instruction as their only source at the beginning,
 *   ignoring constant and uniform operands along the way.
 *
 * Interesting cases implied by this (post-)dominator tree:
 * - load_const, loads without src operands, and undef are not dominated by
 *   anything because they don't have any src operands.
 * - No instruction post-dominates store intrinsics (and all other intrinsics
 *   without a destination) and nir_if nodes (they use a value but don't
 *   produce any).
 *
 * Typical application:
 * - The immediate post-dominator query returns the solution to the problem of
 *   how much code we can move into the previous shader or preamble without
 *   increasing the number of inputs. Example of an SSA-use graph and
 *   the possible result that a user of this utility can produce:
 *
 *          input0 input1             input0 input1
 *              \   / \                  |      \
 *    constant   alu  ...    ------>     |     ...
 *           \   /
 *            alu
 * (immediate post-dominator of input0)
 *
 * Examples of possible applications:
 * - Moving load_input+ALU to the previous shader: An immediate post-dominator
 *   of load_input and all instructions between load_input and the immediate
 *   post-dominator are a candidate for being moved into the previous shader
 *   and we only need to check if the post-dominator is movable. Repeat
 *   the immediate post-dominator query on the accepted post-dominator and see
 *   if that is also movable. Repeat that until you find the farthest post-
 *   dominator that is movable.
 * - Moving load_uniform+ALU to a preamble shader or the CPU: An immediate
 *   post-dominator of load_uniform is a candidate for being moved into
 *   the preamble shader or the CPU. Repeat the immediate post-dominator query
 *   until you find the farthest post-dominator that is movable.
 * - Replacing a value used to compute 2 shader outputs by only 1 output, and
 *   moving the computation into the next shader:
 *   The Lowest Common Ancestor of 2 output stores within the dominator tree
 *   is a candidate for the new replacement output. Any loads that are
 *   trivially movable such as load_const should be ignored by this utility,
 *   otherwise the Lowest Common Ancestor wouldn't exist.
 *
 * Queries:
 * - get the immediate dominator of an instruction
 * - get the Lowest Common Ancestor of 2 instructions
 * - whether one instruction dominates another
 *
 * Implemenation details:
 * - Since some instructions are not dominated by anything, a dummy root is
 *   added into the graph that dominates such instructions, which is required
 *   by the algorithm.
 *
 * TODO: only post-dominance implemented, not dominance

Overview:

	This file is similar in syntax (or more precisly a subset) of what is
	used by the MAINTAINERS file in the linux kernel.  Some fields do not
	apply, for example, in all cases, send patches to:

		mesa-dev@lists.freedesktop.org

	and in all cases the patchwork instance is:

		https://patchwork.freedesktop.org/project/mesa/

	The purpose is not exactly the same the MAINTAINERS file in the linux
	kernel, as there are not official/formal maintainers of different
	subsystems in mesa, but is meant to give an idea of who to CC for
	various patches for review, and to allow the use of
	scripts/get_reviewer.pl as git --cc-cmd.

Usage:

	When sending patches:

		git send-email --cc-cmd ./scripts/get_reviewer.pl ...

	Or to configure as default:

		git config sendemail.cccmd ./scripts/get_reviewer.pl

Descriptions of section entries:

	R: Designated reviewer: FullName <address@domain>
	   These reviewers should be CCed on patches.
	F: Files and directories with wildcard patterns.
	   A trailing slash includes all files and subdirectory files.
	   F:	drivers/net/	all files in and below drivers/net
	   F:	drivers/net/*	all files in drivers/net, but not below
	   F:	*/net/*		all files in "any top level directory"/net
	   One pattern per line.  Multiple F: lines acceptable.
	N: Files and directories with regex patterns.
	   N:	[^a-z]tegra	all files whose path contains the word tegra
	   One pattern per line.  Multiple N: lines acceptable.
	   scripts/get_maintainer.pl has different behavior for files that
	   match F: pattern and matches of N: patterns.  By default,
	   get_maintainer will not look at git log history when an F: pattern
	   match occurs.  When an N: match occurs, git log history is used
	   to also notify the people that have git commit signatures.

Maintainers List (try to look for most precise areas first)

Note: this is an opt-in system, I have not tried to add anyone who hasn't
either asked me or sent a patch to add themselves.
